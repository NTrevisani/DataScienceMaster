# # Multiple Qbits
# 
# Everything here is taken from the IBM quantum computing User Guide and introduction to quantum computing:
# 
# https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/guide/mult-entang/multiple-qubits

# Up to now, we have seen the properties of a qbit and how we can manipulate it.
# 
# Even more interesting is to see the behaviour of systems of more than one qbit and how we can work with them.
# 
# We can describe the system of $n$ qbits as a complex vector of $2^n$ dimensions.
# For example, we can describe a system of 2 qbits as the linear superposition of 4 state vectors:
# 
# $\{ \ket{00}, \ket{01}, \ket{10}, \ket{11} \}$
# 
# where in each vector, the first position refers to the state of the first qbit and the second position refers to the second qbit.
# 
# Now, a classical computer with $n$ bits can assume $2^n$ configurations, but the main difference with respect to a quantum computer is that this one can be in a state of superposition of several states, with qbits entangled together, allowing a much wider range of possibilities.
# 
# In other words, a classical computer with 2 bits can be in any of the following 4 states:
# - 00
# - 01
# - 10
# - 11
# 
# While a quantum computer can be ni any of the following (potentially) infinite states:
# 
# $\ket{\psi} =  \alpha \ket{00} + \beta \ket{01} + \gamma \ket{10} + \delta \ket{11} $ <br>
# 
# with:
# 
# $\alpha^2 + \beta^2 + \gamma^2 + \delta^2 = 1$

# ## Multiple Qbits Control
# 
# In addition to the operators that we already know to control the state of a qbit, we need operators to control more than one qbit or to change the state of a qbit depending on the state of another one.

# ### The Control Gate (CNOT operator)
# 
# This control gate allows two qbits to *communicate*, in particular putting one qbit in control of the other.
# 
# More explicitly, this gate changes the state of the target qbit from $\ket{0}$ to $\ket{1}$ (or from $\ket{1}$ to $\ket{0}$) if the control qbit is in the $\ket{1}$ state, otherwise does nothing.
# 
# If we write the possible states of a 2-qbit quantum cicuit as a vector:
# 
# $ 
# \begin{bmatrix}
#     \ket{00} \\
#     \ket{01} \\
#     \ket{10} \\
#     \ket{11} \\
# \end{bmatrix}
# $
# 
# Then we can express the CNOT operator as follows:
# 
# $ CNOT =
# \begin{bmatrix}
#     1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
#     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
#     0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
#     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
# \end{bmatrix}
# $
# 
# So that we can see the effect on a pair of qbits in each of the possible states:
# 
# $ 
# \begin{bmatrix}
#     1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
#     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
#     0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
#     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
# \end{bmatrix}
# \begin{bmatrix}
#     \ket{00} \\
#     \ket{01} \\
#     \ket{10} \\
#     \ket{11} \\
# \end{bmatrix}
# = 
# \begin{bmatrix}
#     \ket{00} \\
#     \ket{01} \\
#     \ket{11} \\
#     \ket{10} \\
# \end{bmatrix}
# $
# 

# Let's see how the CNOT gate operates with some examples.

# #### 1. Control and target qbit in the fundamental state: $\ket{00}$
# 
# Let's start by applying a CNOT gate keeping the control qbit in the fundamental state $\ket{0}$, when also the target qbit is in the $\ket{0}$ state.
# 
# We expect, in this case, to see no effect on the target qbit state.

# Let's try something similar to the previous case, but now with the target qbit in the $\ket{1}$ state.
# 
# Also in this case, we expect to see no effect on the target qbit state.

# #### 3. Control qbit in the excited state and target qbit in the fundamental state: $\ket{10}$
# 
# Now we want the conotrol qbit to flip the state of the target qbit, so that we put it in the $\ket{1}$ state.
# 
# In this example, we will keep the target qbit in the fundamental state $\ket{0}$.
# 
# To summarize, we start in the $\ket{10}$ state and we expect to finish in the $\ket{11}$ state.
