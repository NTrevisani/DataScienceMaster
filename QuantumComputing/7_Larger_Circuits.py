# Now that we understood the basis of quantum mechanics and how it influences quantum computing, we can start making some exercises to see how to exploit what we learned for actual computing. 

# ## Inverse $CNOT$ gate
# 
# A $CNOT$ gate can be inverted, so that the target qbit becomes the control qbit.
# 
# We can do it by applying two $H$ gates to each of the two qbits involved, one before and one after the $CNOT$ gate.

# ## Swapping qbits states
# 
# We can swap the states of two qbits by applying three $CNOT$ gates as:
# 
# $SWAP_{12} = CNOT_{12} CNOT_{21} CNOT_{12}$
# 
# To understand how it works, let's consider the four possible cases:
# 
# - $\ket{00}$: since both qbits are in the $\ket{0}$ state, nothing happens, as expected;
# - $\ket{11}$: the first qbit (control qbit for the first $CNOT$ gate) is in the $\ket{1}$ state, so it flips the state of the second qbit to $\ket{0}$. This means that the second $CNOT$ gate, controlled by the second qbit, does nothing. Finally, the third $CNOT$ gate, controlled by the first qbit, flips the second qbit state to $\ket{1}$. So no changes, as expected;
# - $\ket{10}$: the first $CNOT$ gate is activated by the first qbit in the $\ket{1}$ state and flips the second qbit to $\ket{1}$. This makes the second $CNOT$ gate active, so that the first qbit is flipped to $\ket{0}$ and the third $CNOT$ gate does nothing. The final state is thus $\ket{01}$;
# - $\ket{01}$: the first $CNOT$ gate is not active since the first qbit is in the $\ket{0}$ state. The second $CNOT$ gate, activated by the second qbit, acts on the first qbit and put it in the $\ket{1}$ state, so that the third $CNOT$ gate becomes active and flips the second qbit to $\ket{0}$. We end up in the $\ket{10}$ state.

# ## Adding a control qbit to a gate
# 
# In general, a $CNOT$ gate can be used to add a control qbit to a gate.
# 
# The $CNOT$ gate itself can be regarded as a controlled $X$ gate. 
# 
# This means that, if we want to use it as a tool for adding a control qbit to a gate $G$, we have to be able to find an operator $O$ such that:
# - if the $CNOT$ gate is not active, nothing happens: $O^{-1}O = 1$;
# - if the $CNOT$ gate is active, it produces the gate $G$: $G = O^{-1} X O$  
# 
# ### Example: controlled Hadamard gate
# 
# To make things clearer, let's try with a simple example, by building a controlled $H$ gate.
# 
# We want to find an operator $O$ such that:
# - $O^{-1}O = 1$;
# - $H = O^{-1} X O$  
# 
# For this, it is easier to think at the $H$ gate as a rotation of 90$^{\circ}$ around the Y axis in the Bloch sphere representation. With this in mind, we can suppose that our $O$ operator is itself a rotation.
# 
# Let's also keep in mind that the X operator switches the $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ states.
# 
# So basically we want $O$ to be a rotation since:
# - $O^{-1}O = 1$ (a rotation of an angle $\theta$ and a rotation of -$\theta$ does nothing);
# - $H = O^{-1} X O$: we want a rotation around the Y axis such that if after this rotation we switch the state $\ket{0}$ with the state $\ket{1}$ in our qbit and then we apply a rotation in the other sense, we get a rotation of 90$^{\circ}$.
# 
# The solution is quite trivial, our $\theta$ angle must be 45$^{\circ}$. Let's see what happens when the $CNOT$ gate is active, since the other case is trivial:
# - if we start with our target qbit in the $\ket{0}$ state and we apply a rotation of $\theta$ = 45$^{\circ}$ ($\frac{\pi}{4}$), we get a superposition of $\frac{\theta}{2}$ = $\frac{\pi}{8}$: <br>
# $\ket{\psi} = \cos(\dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{0} + \sin(\dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{1}$
# 
# - then, we apply the $X$ gate and the target qbit state becomes: <br>
# $\ket{\psi} = \sin(\dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{0} + \cos(\dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{1}$ = 
# $\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{0} + \sin(\dfrac{\pi}{2} - \dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{1}$ = 
# $\cos(3\dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{0} + \sin(3\dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{1}$
# 
# - finally, we apply a rotation of -$\theta$ = 45$^{\circ}$, obtaining: <br> 
# $\cos((3 - 1)\dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{0} + \sin((3 - 1)\dfrac{\pi}{8})\ket{1}$ = 
# $\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{4})\ket{0} + \sin(\dfrac{\pi}{4})\ket{1}$ = 
# $\dfrac{\ket{0} + \ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$
# 
# Now we can verify it with a piece of code.

# ### Control qbit in the $\ket{0}$ state
# 
# Since the control qbit is in the $\ket{0}$ state, we do not expect any change in the state of the target qbit.
