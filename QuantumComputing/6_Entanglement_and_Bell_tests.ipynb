    "### Experimental setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we prepare two qbits in a coherent state as for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ket{\\psi} = \\dfrac{\\ket{00} + \\ket{11}}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we measure the two qbits along the same *direction* (remember the Bloch sphere and the fact that the z-axis connects the $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ states), we will always get the same results for both qbits.\n",
    "In other words, if perform measurement to see if the first qbit is in the $\\ket{0}$ state and we get a positive result, also the measurement of the second qbit state will give a positive result.\n",
    "This is valid not only for measurements along the z-axis, but along any axis of the Bloch sphere, the important thing is that we have to measure both the qbits along the same axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a summary, the results of the measurements of the two qbits, if performed along the same axis, are fully correlated (correlation = +1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's change a bit our measurements: the axes along which we measure the states of the two qbits will now be othogonal to each other.\n",
    "For example, if we measure the state of the first qbit along the z axis, we measure the state of the second qbit along the x axis. This is equivalent to measure if the first qbit is in the $\\ket{0}$ state and if the second qbit is in the $\\ket{+} = \\dfrac{\\ket{0} + \\ket{1}}{\\sqrt{2}}$ state.\n",
    "In this case, the result of the measurement of the first qbit state will not ensure anything about the state of the second qbit. So that, if we measure the first qbit to be in the $\\ket{0}$ state, the second qbit may be in the $\\ket{+}$ state or not, with 50% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the results of the measurements of the two qbits, if performed along two othogonal axes, are not correlated (correlation = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, everything can be explained by the existence of hidden variables that makes it possible to have always fully correlated results when the measurement is made on the same axis for the two qbits and uncorrelated results when the measurement is performed on orthogonal axes.\n",
    "We call them *hidden* variables since we don't have direct acces to them: when we perform a measurement, we just see the result of (indirectly) setting them to the *correct* values in the prepation of the entangled state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all the information needed by the qbits is, in our current assumption, stored in some hidden variable, we are now assuming quantum mechanics is a local and realist theory:\n",
    "- realism: all observables have a definite value independent of the measurement;\n",
    "- locality: no information can travel faster than the speed of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to understand that the results of our measurement depend (under our current assumption) on the state of the hidden variables, so that if we were able to know their state (which we can't!) we would know the outcome of the measurement *before* performing it (realism) so that the qbits do not have to *communicate* with each other to agree on the result of the measurement (locality).
