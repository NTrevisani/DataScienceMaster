    "We have seen that the VQE algorithm is able to find the solution of a QUBO problem, at least with the simple max-cut example that we used as benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the real challenge for quantum computers is managing to provide reliable solutions to such problems faster than classical computers can do with traditional algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned, one feature of quantum computers is that, in order to have a consistent estimation of the cost function associated to a particular configuration of a circuit and its parameters (rotation angles, in our case), its state has to be evaluated several times. The act of evaluating the state of a circuit is usually defined *shot*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, two opposite forces are acting:\n",
    "- More shots mean a more detailed and accurate knowledge of the circuit eigenstate composition;\n",
    "- But more shots mean also more time to reach the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like now to perform a systematic study on how the number of shots affects both the convergence to the optimal solution and the time needed to obtain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we introduce three quantities:\n",
    "- To measure the convergence to the optimal solution, we define the overlap of the solution returned by the optimization process with the solution we found using the *brute force* approach, which is Sol = {[00100],[11011]};\n",
    "- To measure how much it takes to get the solution, we use two quantities:\n",
    "    - The time taken by the algorithm to carry out the optimization process, in seconds;\n",
    "    - The number of evaluations of the cost function times the number of shots. We think this should be a more robust estimator of the computational efficiency, since it corresponds to the number of execution of the ansatz circuit."

    "1. The number of cost function evaluations is quite flat versus the number of shots. Considering that the cost function, as we defined it, includes the execution of the circuit for *numberof shots* times, we can conclude that the number of shots does not significantly affect the capability of the optimization algorithm to find a valid solution.\n",
    "- Taking the previous observation into account, we would expect that increasing the number of shots would require more time to get the solution, since each evaluation of the cost function requires running the ansatz circuit *number of shots* times. However, this is not the case, at least if we look at the second plot, where the time taken to get to the solution is mainly flat versus the number of shots. We can interpret this thinking that the circuit evaluation takes a negligible time with respect to other operations performed by the classical optimizer. On the other hand, we have to take into account that the current results are obtained using a quantum device simulator that runs directly in the laptop used to execute the code. A more proper measure would involve running the whole process using a real quantum device. In that case, however it would be important to take into account in the time estimation, the time spent in the queue (if any) and other possible effects that may inflate our measurements. \n",
    "- We observe a direct dependency between time taken to get to the solution and number of evaluations of the cost function. This suggests, again, that the number of evaluations of the cost function is a valid estimator of the rapidity of the algorithm. Also in this case, a proper measurement using a real quantum device seems to be needed to confirm this impression.\n",
    "- Being the number of cost function evaluations flat versus the number of shots, plotting the elapsed time versus the product of the two quantities is basically the same as plotting the time taken versus the number of shots alone.\n",
    "- Plotting the elapsed time versus log$_2$(shots) seems to indicate a logaritmic dependence of the time versus the number of shots. This may be checked by running many times the optimization for each number of shots and considering the average. "

    "### Best Solution Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we argued that a solution with too many eigenstates cannot be considered as a good solution, since finding the optimal eigenstate is basically the same as solving the problem using a *brute force* approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be good to have a single criterion that allows us to select:\n",
    "- a solution that includes the optimal solution\n",
    "- a solution that, among all, has the lowest number of eigenstates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first try should be given to the value of the solution cost funcion, since intuitively a low cost function corresponds to a large presence of the optimal eigenstate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another figure of merit, recently proposed by IBM researcher, is the conditional value at risk (CVaR), a quantity borrowed from risk studies in finance. It consists in considering, instead of the cost function associated to the whole solution, the cost function associated to the $\\alpha N_{shots}$ lowest eigenvalues. Here $\\alpha \\in (0,1]$ and $N_{shots}$ is the number of shots used to evaluate the optimized ciruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the CVaR is that it works better than the simple cost function in detecting the presence of eigenstates associated to low eigenvalues. For example, let consider two solutions:\n",
    "- S1 = 50% optimal solution + 50% eigenstate associated to highest eigenvalue;\n",
    "- S2 = 100% eigenstate associated to second-lowest eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function will be higher for S1 than for S2, since it considers the average of the lowest and highest eigenvalues for S1, while only the second-lowest eigenvalue for S2.\n",
    "On the other hand, if we select a value of $\\alpha$ between 0 and 0.5, CVaR will consider only the (up to) 50% lowest eigenvalues, so that CVaR prefers S1 to S2."
